Hey, hope you are keeping well. 

I'm Nival & I'm sharing my ML/DL related work here. I come from a biomedical background, and dream of building AI applications that make
healthcare more accessible and affordable. 

I'm pretty much at the beginning of my AI learning journey, so you will find various kinds of beginner-friendly content and pet
projects here, and I try to always make sure I provide correct information from experts in the field, with due credit. 

I'm currently enrolled in the 2022 version of the FastAI course, so you will find that most content are related to my learnings from the course. I have dabbled with fastai before, but this time
I am determined to make a greater effort and be more tenacious, because as FastAI co-founder Jeremy Howard often reminds us, Tenacity is the most important quality to success.
